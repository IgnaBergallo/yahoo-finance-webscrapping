Yahoo finance webscrapping
This project was initiated from a class I took at SFU. My professor has tradition to gather students stock recommendations and invest in the best of them. And how we find a good stock to invest in? That was taught in class. Since there were so many stocks out there and I don't have any preference over any, I want to use programming to get the MVP.

# Yahoo-finance-webscrapping
This project was initiated from a class I took at SFU. My professor has tradition to gather students stock recommendations and invest in the best of them. And how we find a good stock to invest in? In class, I learned that there're 3 formulas to find the estimation of market capitalization rate on common equity (MCR) from the available variables provided by Yahoo Finance:

    #MCR = dy +g

    #E/BVE = (P/BVE)/(P/E)
    #MCR2 = (E/BVE-g)/(P/B) + g

    #MCR3 = E/BVE + (1-P/B)*dy

Since there were so many stocks out there and I don't have any preference over any, I want to use programming to get the MVP.

To run the file (main.py), insert a text file that include all the tickers you are interested in and change the name of variable (fn) to the name of the file you just inserted.
